### Basic study engine and procedure
1. select one thing you really want to do; if it is too big, deconstruct in minor pieces > 'Exacta web page with animations'.
2. pick a good *crash course* on the technologies involved. > 'Framer Motion from the Net Ninja'.
3. do it coding along, with the project that it proposes, with no autocompletion.
4. if a hard doubt, start by writing it as a question in stack overflow in this order:
- Be specific in the title, using technical terminology
- See if your answer is not already answered
- In the body: Say Hi to every one
- Describe colloquially your problem, as synthetic as you could be, using trees - and order
- Explain what you've already tried and if here you discover new things to try,go and do it
- Show more but just the necessary: part of the code, codepen, images or even animated gifs
- If you yet do not discover by yourself the answer, hit send!
- If you discover the answer and anyone else did before, post it and help other! ;-)
- end: be grateful and say thanks
5. apply that to your personal code

### Do not copy and paste; rewrite everything

### Use online platform to experiment (codepen, dartpad)
- No autocompletion > learning basics
- No packages > get creative
- Build small blocks and construct from there
- Onepage teaches you get organized and sequential

### Learn by applying
1. Want to do something
1. Go to docs
1. Build your own
1. Teach it
